Problem Statement: Develop an educational game that teaches students about various health topics, such as nutrition, exercise, mental health, and disease prevention, using interactive quizzes, challenges, and rewards.

Description: In today's fast-paced world, promoting health awareness among students has become increasingly important. However, traditional educational methods often struggle to engage young learners effectively.
As such, there is a pressing need for innovative and interactive platforms that can effectively educate students about various health topics while keeping them engaged and motivated. 
To address this challenge, we propose the development an educational game web designed to teach students about essential health topics such as nutrition, exercise, mental health, and disease prevention.
Health web aims to provide a fun and interactive learning experience that empowers students to make informed decisions about their health and well-being.
